This folder contains scripts that transform raw data into formatted inputs to the water temperature model.

-   **nwm_retrospective**: Downloads forcings and model outputs from the NWM v2.1 Retrospective.
-   **riparian_shading**: Estimates riparian shading along model reaches.
-   **site_data**: Observed data (water temperature, air temperature, gage locations) from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest.
